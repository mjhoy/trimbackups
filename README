trimbackups -- Prune backup files in the spirit of Apple's Time Machine.


USAGE
      $ trimbackups /backups

    The user is prompted whether to delete a set of files under /backups
    that fulfill the trim criteria. By default, looking at the file
    modification time, these are files that represent more than one file
    per (a) hour, for the last 24 hours; (b) day, for the last month;
    (c) week; for anything before the last month.

      $ trimbackups -y /backups

    Same as above, but confirmation is not requested.

      $ trimbackups --dry-run /backups

    A list of files that would be deleted are printed, plus a summary of
    the disk space that would be freed.
