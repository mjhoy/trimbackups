trimbackups -- Prune backup files in the spirit of Apple's Time Machine.

SYNOPSIS
    trimbackups [ options ] <path>

DESCRIPTION
    trimbackups examines all files under <path> and, based on file
    modification time and rules about how many backups to keep,
    deletes some subset.

    The rules are:

      Now to 24 hours ago -> keep all files in this timeframe.

      24 hours to 2 weeks -> keep one file per 6 hours.

      2 weeks to 2 months -> keep one file per 24 hours.

      Past 2 months -> keep one file per week.

    -y                       Delete files without confirmation
    --dry-run                Print a summary of what would be deleted
    --report                 Print a summary

EXAMPLES
      $ trimbackups /backups

    If any files exist under /backups that should be deleted following
    the trim criteria (above), the user is asked whether to delete
    them.

      $ trimbackups -y /backups

    Same as above, but confirmation is not requested.

      $ trimbackups --report /backups

    Same as above, but a list of the files deleted and disk space

    the disk space that would be freed.
